Modal Confirmation Dialog Example Project with jQuery and MVC3

This sample code demonstrates how to create a simple HTML form in a C# MVC3 web application with data annotation validation. The form displays a jQuery modal confirmation dialog upon clicking the form submit button, allowing the user to confirm the data prior to submitting. The confirmation dialog can easily be ported to different web applications by making minor changes to the HTML for the dialog and associated javascript.
